# Stock Price Prediction
This repository contains two models for predicting stock prices:
1. Linear Regression Model
2. LSTM Model
Each model is contained in its own directory with the necessary code, data, and instructions.
## Directory Structure
- `linear-regression/`: Contains the linear regression model.
- `lstm/`: Contains the LSTM model.


# Linear Regression Model for Stock Price Prediction
This directory contains the code and data for a linear regression model to predict stock prices.
## Files
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
  - `stock_prices.csv`: The dataset file.
- `linear_regression_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the complete code.
- `README.md`: This file with instructions.
